A school project by Siva and Jerico

We want to help those from bwd and also other people just started learning how to program.

The only language we currently tackle is PHP but we will keep adding more in the future.

You can register an account and after logging in you will have three choices:

Fill In the Blanks: We show you a screenshot of our code, there is a blank space and a comment to help you find out what the answer is.

Multiple Choice: A phrase/question will be shown and there are four choices but only one of those is correct.

Finding Pairs: You have three pairs and you need to pair all of them.

Each question has its own difficulty, that means the points given/reduce will also differ on the question.
